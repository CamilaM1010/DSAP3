How to run the program:

Put all of the c++ files on an IDE, we used CLion so we recommend to use that one as well.

Make sure that the video_game.csv file is in the directory where the rest of the files are. 
Also, if it's being run on CLion, go to edit configurations and make sure the working directory is the current directory you're in. 
After that, the code relies on the user's input. The prompts will let you know what you could input.

If there are any issues, please reach out to any of us on our discords. They are listed in final report
